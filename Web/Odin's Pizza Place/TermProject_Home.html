<strong>Our Mission:</strong> To make the best and tastiest pizzas that a norseman should eat before entering Valhalla!
<br>
<br>
<strong>Customer Reviews:</strong> "I think these Vikings are mad, but their pizza is really good."
<br>
<br> "Their pizzas are really good, but the one with the orange beard kinda scares me."
<br>
<br>"Their pizzas are definitely worth coming in for, but when I asked for soda, 
	the waiter said I am "NO MAN" and instead gave me a horn with mead in it. Other then that I enjoyed my time there, 
	the mead was really good too."
<br>
<br>"The pizza was great but why does the waiter have a dead wolf on his head?"
